# Projects
## Inception ![Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/Not_started-red)
Currently working on implementing a wordpress website using a mariadb database and NGINX server on three seperate docker images. You can find the source code and documentation [here](https://github.com/FrancisL93/inception).

## C++ Piscine ![Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/In_progress-8/9-yellow)
Learned the c++ std-98 basics and intermediates fundamentals through a series of modules and exercises. I had to implement my own classes, use containers, work with exceptions and use specific c++ functions. You can find the source code and documentation [here](https://github.com/FrancisL93/cpp-piscine).

## NetPractice ![Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/2023_01_22-100%-green)
Through network simulations I learned about packet routing, modems, routers, ips and masks.

## Cub3d ![Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/2022_12_19-125%-green)
Created a simple 3D game using C and the Raycasting algorithm. Implemented features such as textured walls, floors, ceilings and player movement. Collaborated with another student to design and implement the project. Gained experience with game development and graphics programming. You can find the source code and documentation [here](https://github.com/FrancisL93/cub3d).

## Minishell ![Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/2022/10/18-101%-green)
Created a simple shell program using C that supports basic command execution and input/output redirection. Implemented features such as handling signals, managing environment variables, and basic job control. Collaborated with another student to design and implement the project.
Gained experience with system calls and shell scripting. You can find the source code and documentation [here](https://github.com/FrancisL93/minishell).

## Philosophers ![Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/2022_08_15-100%-green)
I developed a multithreaded solution to the classic dining philosophers problem using C and POSIX threads. You can find the source code and documentation [here](https://github.com/FrancisL93/philosophers).

## Pipex ![Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/2022_07_11-100%-green)
Pipex is a command-line utility program that simulates the behavior of the Unix pipeline, allowing users to redirect the input and output of two commands in a single command line. I learned about creating child processes, and setting up pipes for inter-process communication. You can find the source code and documentation [here](https://github.com/FrancisL93/pipex).

## So_long ![Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/2022_07_08-115%-green)
So_Long is a 2D game written in C using the Minilibx graphics library, where the player must navigate a maze and collect items while avoiding obstacles. I was responsible for implementing the game logic, including collision detection, movement, and scoring. You can find the source code and documentation [here](https://github.com/FrancisL93/so_long).

## Push_Swap ![Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/2022_06_23-86%-green)
Push_Swap is a program that I developed at 42Quebec. It's a sorting algorithm that's designed to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. You can find the source code and documentation [here](https://github.com/FrancisL93/push_swap).

## Born2BeRoot![Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/2022_05_09-110%-green)
Born2beroot is a project that focuses on setting up and securing a basic Linux server. I learned how to install and configure a server operating system (debian), as well as how to secure the server by implementing best practices for network security. The project includes tasks such as setting up user accounts, configuring network interfaces, installing and configuring firewalls, and setting up basic monitoring and logging.

## Get_Next_Line ![Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/2022_05_09-100%-green)
Get_Next_Line is a function that I implemented as part of my studies at 42 Network. It's a useful function for reading text files line by line, and it's often used in other programs. You can find the source code and documentation [here](https://github.com/FrancisL93/get_next_line).

## Ft_printf ![Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/2022_04_19-100%-green)
Printf is a function that I implemented as part of my studies at 42 Network. It's a popular function that's used to print formatted text to the console. You can find the source code and documentation [here](https://github.com/FrancisL93/ft_printf).

## Libft ![Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/2022_04_13-125%-green)
Libft is a library of useful functions that I developed as a student at 42 Network. It includes functions for memory management, string manipulation, and more. You can find the source code and documentation [here](https://github.com/FrancisL93/libft).
